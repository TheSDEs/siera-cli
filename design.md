# Aries Data Generator Toolkit

## Goal

The goal of this toolkit is to quickly interact with an Aries agent, ACA-Py and
AFJ for now, for data manipulation. It MUST be possible to create a connection,
issue a credential, present a proof, batch every call, via config.

## Design

It should be as minimal as possible where almost everything happens in the
configuration file. This file is a JSON file that describes what the tool is
supposed to do.
